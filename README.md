- 👋 Hi, I’m @visolerga
- 👀 I’m interested in ... re-learning, getting myself into programming again, some alredy got knowledge but pushing a bit with java (backend) and python, some interest in react but only for practical reason
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Git? in fact learning a bit more everyday, keep on java (already got some practice with EE, now with Spring), trying python and looking into React.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything I can prove valuable and of course helps me improve
- 📫 How to reach me ... 2nd cloud left, but vsoler@gmail.com is more practical
- 😄 Pronouns: ... Me? lol
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... from today or last days? ask my wife sure she keeps track of them...
